# voxy-qa-challenge

👨‍🎓 Technical challenge for a QA role at Voxy.

❗ Those two tests where selected to be automated since they represent a more complete user flow.

## How to run

1️⃣ Install dependencies

I've use npm as the package manager. After cloning the project, open your terminal emulator and run the command:

```
npm i
```

2️⃣ Run the tests!

To run the tests in headless mode run the following command:

```
npm test
```

Alternatively, if you want to run the test on visible mode you can open Cypress Test Runner with the command:

```
npm run cypress
```
